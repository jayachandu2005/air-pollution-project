        <p><h2 class="two">1.Respiratory Problems:</h2> <br>Exposure to air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), ground-level ozone (smog), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) can lead to a variety of respiratory problems. These include worsened asthma, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and increased susceptibility to respiratory infections.</br>

          <h2 class="two">2.Cardiovascular Effects:</h2> <br>Air pollution has been linked to an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular problems. Fine particulate matter can enter the bloodstream and contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of plaque in the arteries.</br>
          
          <h2 class="two">3.Cancer:</h2> <br>Some air pollutants, such as benzene, formaldehyde, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are known carcinogens. Prolonged exposure to these substances in polluted air can increase the risk of developing cancer.</br>
          
          <h2 class="two">4.Neurological Effects:</h2> <br>Emerging research suggests that air pollution may have adverse effects on the central nervous system and cognitive function. There is growing concern about the potential links between air pollution and conditions like Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.</br>
          
          <h2 class="two">5.Reduced Lung Function:</h2><br>Children exposed to air pollution may experience reduced lung growth and development, which can have long-term consequences for their respiratory health. Adults may also experience a decline in lung function over time due to exposure to pollutants.</br>
          
          <h2 class="two">6.Pregnancy and Birth Outcomes:</h2> <br>Pregnant women exposed to air pollution may be at higher risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and developmental issues in their children. Air pollution can also impact fertility and male reproductive health.</br>
          
          <h2 class="two">7.Allergies and Asthma:</h2> <br>Air pollution can exacerbate allergies and asthma symptoms. It can also increase the prevalence of allergic sensitization, making individuals more susceptible to allergic reactions.</br>
          
          <h2 class="two">8.Visibility and Aesthetic Impact:</h2> <br>Air pollution can reduce visibility, particularly in urban areas. It can contribute to the formation of haze, smog, and poor air quality, affecting the aesthetic appeal of landscapes and landmarks.</br>
          
          <h2 class="two">9.Ecosystem and Wildlife Impact:</h2> <br>Air pollution can harm ecosystems and wildlife. Acid rain, which is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, can damage forests, lakes, and aquatic life. Ground-level ozone can harm vegetation and crops, affecting agricultural productivity.</br>
          
          <h2 class="two">10.Climate Change:</h2> <br>Some air pollutants, such as greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), contribute to global climate change, leading to rising temperatures and associated environmental impacts.</br>
