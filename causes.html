        <p><br>Describe the major sources of air pollution and their impact on the environment and health.</br>
          <h2 class="two">1.Industrial Emissions:</h2></h2><br>Factory Emissions: Industrial facilities, including manufacturing plants, refineries, and chemical factories, release a range of pollutants into the air, such as particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
          Power Plants: Fossil fuel-fired power plants, particularly coal-fired ones, are significant sources of air pollution. They emit pollutants like carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide, and NOx.
          </br>
          <h2 class="two">2.Transportation:</h2><br>Automobiles: Motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, and buses, emit exhaust gases containing CO2, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and VOCs.
          Aircraft: Airplanes release emissions at high altitudes, including NOx and particulate matter.
          Shipping and Rail: Transportation modes like shipping and rail contribute to air pollution through the combustion of diesel fuels.</br>
          <h2 class="two">3.Agriculture:</h2><br>Livestock Farming: Animal husbandry, especially in confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), generates ammonia (NH3) and methane (CH4).
          Fertilizer Application: The use of synthetic fertilizers results in ammonia emissions, which can lead to the formation of particulate matter and ground-level ozone.</br>
          <h2 class="two">4.Residential Heating and Cooking:</h2> Burning wood, coal, and other solid fuels for heating and cooking can produce indoor and outdoor air pollution.</br>
          <h2 class="two">5.Natural Sources:</h2><br>Volcanic Eruptions: Volcanic eruptions release gases and particulate matter into the atmosphere, affecting air quality on a regional or global scale.
          Wildfires: Wildfires emit particulate matter, VOCs, and carbon monoxide, impacting air quality and posing health risks.
          Dust and Soil Erosion:
          
          Windblown dust and soil erosion can result in particulate matter entering the air, especially in arid and agricultural regions.
          Chemical Reactions and Atmospheric Processes:
          
          Photochemical smog formation: The interaction between NOx and VOCs in the presence of sunlight can lead to the formation of ground-level ozone and other secondary pollutants.</br>
